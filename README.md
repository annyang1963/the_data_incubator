# the_data_incubator
This is a proposal for the data incubator program. The core of this project is to determine userâ€™s lifestyle based on the transaction information. The dataset contains features such as user id, name, profile_picture_url, date joined, date transaction created, action of pay or charge and transaction description. Possible methods are machine learning that can classify different activities, food and current status; careful analysis on transaction notes and date transaction created will help identify the details of personality and activity frequency.
