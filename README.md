# the_data_incubator
This is a project proposal for the data incubator program. The core of this project is to determine userâ€™s lifestyle based on the transaction information. The dataset contains features such as user id, user name, profile_picture_url, date joined, date transaction created, action of pay or charge and transaction description. 

The origenal data contains more than 7,000,000 records, 3,000,000 rows that contains about than 2,300,000 users were analysed to test the feasibility of the project. Activity features and food features are identified using only transaction description. First plot shows the ratio of transaction in different catagory to total transaction. Then the same analysis was performed on a single user, which has 32 valid records. The second plot shows the results of the unser's connections. The user has 9 connections and they have different activity pattern as shown by the plot.


To futher extract the features, machine learning can be used to classify different activities, food and behaviors; analysis on transaction notes and date transaction created can identify the activity frequency and lifestyle.

The mayor drawback of the dataset is that not all users accurately describe the transaction due to reasons such as privacy. This can be solved with the assistance of other social network platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.
