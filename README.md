# the_data_incubator
This is a proposal for the data incubator program. The core of this project is to determine userâ€™s lifestyle based on the transaction information. The dataset contains features such as user id, name, profile_picture_url, date joined, date transaction created, action of pay or charge and transaction description. Possible methods are machine learning that can classify different activities, food and current status; careful analysis on transaction notes and date transaction created will help identify the details of personality and activity frequency.

The mayor drawback of the dataset is that not all the users write notes that accurately describe the transaction due to reasons such as privacy and the feeling of unnecessary. This may be solved with the assistance of other social network platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.
